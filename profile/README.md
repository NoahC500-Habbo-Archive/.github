# Welcome
All my Habbo-related repos have been moved to this organisation to clean up my main GitHub account.
The following are/were private ([email me](mailto:noah.habbowh@gmail.com) if you require or want access):
* [NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/habbo-folder](https://github.com/NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/habbo-folder/) &ndash; Contains various userscripts, maps, handbooks, and notes that I created at HabboUK & HabGov.
* [NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/the-house-record](https://github.com/NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/the-house-record/) &ndash; The beginnings of a Hansard-like publication; I think more of this is on GDrive than GH.
* [NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/mi-drive-backup](https://github.com/NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/mi-drive-backup/) &ndash; MI's leadership's shared drive.
* [NoahC500-Habbo-Archives/dq-screenies](https://github.com/NoahC500-Habbo-Archives/dq-screenies/) &ndash; All of the screenshots I took to prove my shifts at HabboUK.
