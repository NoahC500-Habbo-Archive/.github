The Habbo White House has opened under `Reichsprasident`,\* and with that comes an excuse for me to log back in!

The only vaguely maintained thing on here right now is [habboRedirects](https://github.com/NoahC500-Habbo-Archive/habboRedirects/): a simple web document used to open my Habbo Firefox container. Pre-December 2025 I used a number of microsites hosted by Glitch (RIP) with a similar approach.

I intend on figuring out TeX (yes… Habbo is my excuse lol) and writing templates, etc., for House/US-style bills. These will appear on here for others' reference if I do. This will probably be made redundant when we get a proper site up and running, but I don't mind.

\* Edit 15/01/2026: Now `Praeceptor` (same person).
